# What do I do?

Supporting researchers with their first steps in scientific computing and High Performance Computing, lowering barrier to asking questions and using resources, training, docs and tuturials, outreach.

CodeRefinery - teaching, organizing, outreach, facilitation , "RSE for researchers "

Sharing what helped me, support discoverability

Opening the doors to Nordic-RSE, sharing, exchanging

Community building and facilitating the exchange, visibility

Bringing in news from other RSE communities

Finnish and Nordic-RSE and CodeRefinery, bringing in Geoinformatics

# Background - Why is it needed?

No funding, little support, but motivated people

Learning from experts in Nordics and UK

RSEs exist but they might not know it yet

RSE practices not well known among (geoinformatics) researchers

# What specifically?

1. Get to know RSE situation in Nordics 
2. Compare with other countries and survey how they support the community,  build network
3. Support Nordic_RSE conference organization and facilitate workshop
4. Collect what I learned from others and from potential members in blogposts
