# Dagstuhl seminars

> Dagstuhl Seminars are the flagship of the event program at Schloss Dagstuhl.
> They are often praised by participants as the most productive academic events they have ever experienced.
> Consequently participation is highly coveted. Their topic can be anything that is computer science related.
> These seminars focus on the exchange and development of ideas and not so much on the presentation of already achieved results.
> They profit from Dagstuhl's ambience and setup that promote personal interaction and open discussion.
