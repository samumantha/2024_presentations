# Abstract (not to be included in presentation)

The CodeRefinery project has been teaching FAIR research software development practices since 2016. My part in this started when I joined a CodeRefinery workshop at my university in 2018. I was fascinated by all the topics taught in the workshop: Version control, documentation, reproducible workflows, modular code development, social coding and automatic testing among others.

One thing lead to another, and I went from a participant to a workshop helper and then became an instructor. Eventually I took on the role of a community manager for the project in 2024. Along the way I got to grow myself with the Carpentries instructor training as well as spreading the word about the project by talking about it in many different forums.

CodeRefinery taught me not only how I can refine my own code and make it more reusable by others, but also how to organize my own work better for myself. In addition I realized that through CodeRefinery I can help others by passing on what I have learned and open that gateway for others too.

With this presentation I would like to encourage everyone to be brave and explore communities that call to you. The RSE community will welcome you warmly and give guidance on your path to becoming an RSE, if that is what you wish to do.

# Journey overview

Stations from researcher -> researcher who codes -> HPC user -> CodeRefinery participant -> colleague researcher supporter with tech stuff -> CodeRefinery volunteer -> Carpentries instructor -> CodeRefinery instructor -> HPC Geoinformatics specialist -> HPC application specialist -> CodeRefinery community manager -> here.

# Writing code

Goal: process and analyse satellite imagery for forestry/agriculture using HPC
Existing tools: not sufficient 
Own laptop: Not enough memory, not fast enough to do analysis
Solution: Write own code, use HPC

Picture: me with data on one side, mountain of limitations (memory, time, tools), goal of pretty satellite pictures behind mountain; taking first step by writing own code, smaller mountain of limitations coming from not using version control, not documenting, not using modular code etc.

# CodeRefinery

Some time later
Learned about CodeRefinery workshops, in person at Aalto. Perfect fit for what I needed.

- **Introduction to version control**: Git and GitHub for own projects
- **Collaborative version control**: Branching, pull/merge requests, forks, and collaboration.
- **Reproducible research**: Reproducible dependencies, environments, and computational steps.
- **Social coding and open software**: Software and data licensing and software citation.
- **How to document your research software**
- **Reusable and reproducible Jupyter notebooks**
- **Automated testing**: Motivation, test design, and tools.
- **Modular code development**: Organizing projects as they grow from one screen-full to larger.

# Excitement

First mention of RSE and people doing RSE stuff, whole new world and new possibilities, becoming part of CodeRefinery (joined the chat, sometimes meetings), helper in workshop
Super supportive community, encouragement to try out things

Picture: RSE as careerpath with stepping stones

---

# Job opportunity

CodeRefinery/ Carpentries instructor training, learning from others, supporting and teaching smaller workshops, eg Conda for data scientists from Carpentries incubator, wonderful onboarding through co-instructing, 
Carpentries mentoring program with Jeanetta, first RSE meetings (by accident), RSE becoming a possible career path

-> Job opportunity at CSC- IT Center for Science, not quite RSE but close, CodeRefinery experience highly regarded, support from CR community for application, lots of tips because many also work at HPC centers, got the job (I never ever would have imagined being able to get)

# Continuing the journey

CR: co-instructing, material dev, organizing, community building, outreach -> Community manager
CSC: research support, email, weekly user support sessions, training (HPC beginner for GIS, Spatial ML), lots of ideas and contacts from CR

Nordic-RSE: Outreach

Strong connection, nowadays it is my job to combine these, bridging gaps between researchers and IT experts, Collaboartive training, community building

Picture: Connection between work and CR/Nordic-RSE arrows benefiting each other

# Go out and find your people

Join communities, start your own, local chapters, ... find your people. 
Making it your job to work with them makes things easier
Openning new doors can bring new opportunities that you never though about "don't know what you don't know"

Picture: RSE pathway with the community, support building the stairs to reach "RSE", but also showing that RSE starts "earlier than you might think" (personal opinion)
